I love The Walking Dead, Grimm, The Blacklist and Drunk History. So bascially, I'm a zombie lover who adores fantastical fairy tales, criminals with a heart (and smarts) and a somewhat skewed view of history. Despite all that (or perhaps because of it), I love helping people: online support and in person support. We're all humans, except for the zombies, so hand to hand we can change the world!
